		<h2>A funny story</h2>
		<p>Once I went to the university just to see a class, I noticed that people were looking at me a lot, "Today I'm looking very good smirk" I thought, my teacher never came so I returned home, when I was on the bus I saw my reflection in the window and I noticed that I had my shirt backwards... that's why they were looking at me a lot smile</p>
		<h3>TL;DR:</h3>
		<p>Check your shirt twice before leaving home.</p>
